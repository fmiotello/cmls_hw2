# Subtractive Synth

This is a simple subtractive synthesizer plugin made with [JUCE](https://juce.com).It was developed as a project for the Computer Music: Languages and Systems course in [Politecnico of Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/)(MSc in Music and Acoustic Engineering).

## Installation

Use the Projucer app to build the plugin. An already built VST3 version is already available in the 'Build' directory.

Have fun!
