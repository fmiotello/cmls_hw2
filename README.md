# Subtractive Synth

This is a simple subtractive synthesizer plugin made with [JUCE](https://juce.com). It was developed as a project for the Computer Music: Languages and Systems course in [Politecnico of Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/) (MSc in Music and Acoustic Engineering).

## Installation

The Projucer app, made available by JUCE, will help in the building process, as it handles many things automatically. The output file needs to be placed in the correct path, in order to be visible by your preferred DAW.

An already built VST3 version is available in `/Build` directory.

Have fun!
